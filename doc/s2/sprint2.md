
The goal of this sprint was to finish up all design patterns and features that were not already implemented in sprint 1, ie: to completely finish the game. The user stories for this sprint
are as follows:

User Story 2.1	Audio Feature,
User Story 2.2	Changing Agent Feature,
User Story 2.3	Presentation Slides,	
User Story 2.5	Special Move Feature,

We decided to not change any of the original design patterns, and instead just completely implement them, bug fix them, and add inter-connecting features to some of them to make all the features adaptive. We expected to complete everything by the end of this sprint (and we did)

We decided to change and edit some of the classes to better fit our designs, specifically, the audio feature got edited a lot.
