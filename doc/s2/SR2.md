RETROSPECTIVE THOUGHTS ON SPRINT 2

The participations in this meeting are Thomas Kolman, Nasim Bondar Sahebi, Justin Zhang and Razi Messinger.

Every user story was finished, all bugs seem to have been taken care of.

There was tight cohesion and excellent group work this sprint. The team as a whole was a lot more familiar with Git and Github, and so the merging and pushing was a
lot more seamless than before. As well, the understanding of each other's code grew, and so we were able to do much more intertwined code that took advantage of each
other's features.

On the next project, we would definitely break up Git commits more often, start taking advantage of Git rollbacks and overall just try and have a cleaner Git history
so that everything can be tracked. As well, we would place a higher emphasis on integrability of our code with each other's, since many of our headaches came from 
not understanding the changes made by someone else.

One particularly harmful practice, mentioned before but not elaborated on, is the lack of git history documentation, which hurts us with respect to being able to 
safely introduce new features without fear of anything breaking. On top of that, there was a lack of testing that was done to the code, which does end up introducing
nasty bugs that crop up later.

Easily the best experience in sprint 2 was collaborating with the team and becoming fast friends. The worst experience, on the other hand, had to do with stress - 
the project deadline is simply too close to other exams.
