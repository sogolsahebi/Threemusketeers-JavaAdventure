Retrospective Thoughts on Sprint 1

The participants in this meeting were Thomas Kolman, Nasim Bondar Sahebi, Justin Zhang and Razi Messinger.

Most tasks were finished, the only unfinished task to be done is feature 1.6, being able to switch agents mid game.

There was good communication during the latter half of the week. The group all shouldered their fair share of responsibility and did their part, but also there was
plenty of collaboration between team members. The code is relatively clean and does not have any obvious errors. The lion's share of the features was taken care of,
with arguably the easiest feature remaining. Task distribution was well done, and everyone got roughly the same amount of work.

Good practices to adopt would be an increased use of abstraction when designing classes so that everything is not coupled with the 'ThreeMusketeers.java' and 
'Board.java' class. Furthermore, their is an overreliance on class level variables, which can produce confusing code. This oftentimes led to some initializing timing
errors that plagued the code, where the object was accessed before it was instantiated. In terms of teamwork, it would be wise to adopt an increased frequency of
git commits so that the commits are more "bite-sized" and readable.

There was little frequency of communication in the first half of the week up until Thursday. It is true that people are busy with other classes, but there should at
least be some early coordination. As well, the commit messages need to be prepended with the feature number and made more clear.

The memorable experience obviously is the camaraderie developed, all of us have been on long calls trying to get our code to work well. The worst experience is
definitely the git merging conflicts, which had caused some pretty bad headaches among us. Overall, the experience was good, and sprint 1 went mostly according to
plan.
