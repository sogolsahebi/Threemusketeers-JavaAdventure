
The goal if this sprint (sprint1) is to get the entire project started; every user story at least must be started.
We planned on getting most of the user stories finished and allowing them to be refined in the following sprint (sprint 2).

Here are all of the stories for this sprint:

User Story 1: Save Feature,
User Story 2: Hint feature,
User Story 3: Audience feature,
User Story 4: Special Moves feature,
User Story 5: Audio feature,
User Story 6: agent feature.

We decided to add another feature, perhaps using the design pattern 'null pattern' for hint, and perhaps updating AUdio and / or special moves 
with more features in sprint2. We expect to complete about 3/4 or 75% of our game by sprint1, leaving the remaining 25% to be a couple new features
and refining old features.
